## Description

This was a school project of building a website using API endpoints provided by the school.
The features included in this app are:
- Browse and search through items
- Log in or Register
- Play a game of chess with another registered user
- Post a comment with an option of anonymity


**Note:**
- Because past students can access and also use the same endpoints the online chess game may not operate as intended unless both users are using this website to verse eachother
  *(As the methods of using the endpoints in the client side is unique to each student)*
